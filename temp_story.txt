“Create an 8-panel manga-style scene in clean black-and-white with consistent character design.
Main character: Arin, a young scientist (mid-20s), messy hair, slim build, white lab coat, expressive eyes.
Setting: A cluttered tech-lab with monitors, tools, papers, and glowing devices. Use manga-style shading, screentones, and panel composition.

Panel 1: Wide shot. Arin enters the lab holding a coffee mug, looking exhausted.
Dialogue (Arin): “Another long night… but I have to finish this prototype.”

Panel 2: Arin notices a faintly glowing metal cube on the desk.
Dialogue (Arin): “Huh? Did I leave this thing on?”

Panel 3: Close-up of the cube levitating and releasing bright energy.
Dialogue (Arin, off-panel): “No way… it’s reacting?”

Panel 4: Papers and tools float around Arin as he shields his eyes from the light.
Dialogue (Arin): “Stop—stop! You’re not supposed to activate!”

Panel 5: A swirling portal tears open behind him, showing a futuristic neon city.
Dialogue (Arin): “A portal?! I definitely didn’t build that!”

Panel 6: Arin steps closer, cautious but intrigued.
Dialogue (Arin): “Should I… look inside?”

Panel 7: He stands at the edge, shocked by flying vehicles and towering holograms.
Dialogue (Arin): “This is insane… but incredible.”

Panel 8: Rear view of Arin walking into the portal, swallowed by its glow.
Dialogue (Arin): “Alright… let’s see where this leads.”

Style notes: Use manga screentones, speed lines, expressive faces, dramatic lighting, and Japanese panel flow conventions (top-to-bottom, right-to-left if supported).”
